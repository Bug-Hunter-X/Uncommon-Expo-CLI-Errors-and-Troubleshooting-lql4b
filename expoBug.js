This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to manage an Expo project, specifically when attempting to run `expo start` or related commands.  The underlying cause frequently involves conflicts between different versions of Node.js, npm (or yarn), or Expo itself. Sometimes, it's related to incorrect configuration of your project's package.json or expo.json files, while other times it may involve issues with your system's environment variables or local dependencies.
