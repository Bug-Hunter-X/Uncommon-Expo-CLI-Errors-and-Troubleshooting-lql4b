The solution depends on the specific error.  Common solutions involve:

1.  **Updating Node.js and npm:** Ensure you have the latest versions installed.  Expo often requires specific version ranges.
2.  **Checking package.json/expo.json:** Verify the correctness of these configuration files.  Errors in dependencies or Expo configurations can cause issues.
3.  **Cleaning the cache:** Try running `expo prebuild` to clear the build cache.  Also remove and reinstall node_modules and clear the yarn or npm cache.
4.  **Inspecting environment variables:** Look for potential conflicts between globally installed packages and project-specific dependencies.
5.  **Using a specific Node version manager (like nvm):** Managing multiple Node.js versions will help you isolate the exact version compatibility issues.
6.  **Reinstalling Expo CLI:** `npm uninstall -g expo-cli && npm install -g expo-cli` 

The corrected `expoBugSolution.js` file will demonstrate how to implement these fixes based on a specific problem (e.g., fixing a missing dependency by updating package.json or fixing a conflict by upgrading to a newer version of expo-cli)
